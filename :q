       Yay is a Pacman wrapper with AUR support. It passes options to Makepkg and Pacman after
       resolving packages to install/upgrade.

       This manpage only covers options unique to Yay. For other options see ppaaccmmaann((88)).

YYAAYY OOPPEERRAATTIIOONNSS
       --YY,, ----yyaayy
              Perform yay specific operations. This is the default if no other operation is
              selected and targets are defined.

       --BB,, ----bbuuiilldd
              Build a PKGBUILD in a given directory.

       --PP,, ----sshhooww
              Perform yay specific print operations.

       --GG,, ----ggeettppkkggbbuuiilldd
              Downloads PKGBUILD from ABS or AUR. The ABS can only be used for Arch Linux
              repositories.

       --WW,, ----wweebb
              Web related operations such as voting for AUR packages.

       If no operation is specified 'yay -Syu' will be performed

       If no operation is specified and targets are provided -Y will be assumed

EEXXTTEENNDDEEDD PPAACCMMAANN OOPPEERRAATTIIOONNSS
       --SS,, --SSii,, --SSll,, --SSss,, --SSuu,, --SScc,, --QQuu
              These operations are extended to support both AUR and repo packages.

       --SScc    Yay will also clean cached AUR package and any untracked Files in the cache. Cleaning
              untracked files will wipe any downloaded sources or built packages but will keep
              already downloaded vcs sources.

       --RR     Yay will also remove cached data about devel packages.

NNEEWW OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ----rreeppoo Assume all targets are from the repositories. Additionally Actions such as sysupgrade
              will only act on repository packages.

       --aa,, ----aauurr
              Assume all targets are from the AUR. Additionally Actions such as sysupgrade will
              only act on AUR packages.

              Note that dependency resolving will still act normally and include repository
              packages.

YYAAYY OOPPTTIIOONNSS ((AAPPPPLLYY TTOO --YY AANNDD ----YYAAYY))
       <<NNOO OOPPTTIIOONN>>
              Displays a list of packages matching the search terms and prompts the user on which
              packages to install (yogurt mode).

              The first search term is used to query the different sources and the following search
              terms are used to narrow the search results through exact matching.

       ----ggeennddbb
              Generate development package database. Tracks the latest commit for each development
              package, when there is a new commit Yay will know to update. This is done per package
              whenever a package is synced. This option should only be used when migrating to Yay
              from another AUR helper.

       --cc,, ----cclleeaann
              Remove unneeded dependencies.

SSHHOOWW OOPPTTIIOONNSS ((AAPPPPLLYY TTOO --PP AANNDD ----sshhooww))
       --cc,, ----ccoommpplleettee
              Print a list of all AUR and repo packages. This allows shell completion and is not
              intended to be used directly by the user.

       --dd,, ----ddeeffaauullttccoonnffiigg
              Print default yay configuration.

       --gg,, ----ccuurrrreennttccoonnffiigg
              Print current yay configuration.

       --ss,, ----ssttaattss
              Displays information about installed packages and system health. If there are
              orphaned, or out-of-date packages, or packages that no longer exist on the AUR;
              warnings will be displayed.

       --ww,, ----nneewwss
              Print new news from the Archlinux homepage. News is considered new if it is newer
              than the build date of all native packages. Pass this twice to show all available
              news.

       --qq,, ----qquuiieett
              Only show titles when printing news.

BBUUIILLDD OOPPTTIIOONNSS ((AAPPPPLLYY TTOO --BB AANNDD ----bbuuiilldd))
       --ii,, ----iinnssttaallll
              Build and install a PKGBUILD in a given directory

GGEETTPPKKGGBBUUIILLDD OOPPTTIIOONNSS ((AAPPPPLLYY TTOO --GG AANNDD ----ggeettppkkggbbuuiilldd))
       --ff,, ----ffoorrccee
              Force download for ABS packages that already exist in the current directory. This
              ensures directories are not accidentally overwritten.

       --pp,, ----pprriinntt
              Prints the PKGBUILD of the given packages to stdout.

WWEEBB OOPPTTIIOONNSS ((AAPPPPLLYY TTOO --WW AANNDD ----wweebb))
       Web related operations such as voting for AUR packages.
              Requires setting AUR_USERNAME and AUR_PASSWORD environment variables.

       --uu,, ----uunnvvoottee
              Remove vote from AUR package(s)

       --vv,, ----vvoottee
              Vote for AUR package(s)

PPEERRMMAANNEENNTT CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN SSEETTTTIINNGGSS
       ----ssaavvee Causes the following options to be saved back to the config file. This provides an
              easy way to change config options without directly editing the file.

       ----aauurruurrll
              Set an alternative AUR URL.

       ----aauurrrrppccuurrll
              Set an alternative URL for the AUR /rpc endpoint.

       ----bbuuiillddddiirr <<ddiirr>>
              Directory to use for Building AUR Packages. This directory is also used as the AUR
              cache when deciding if Yay should skip builds.

       ----eeddiittoorr <<ccoommmmaanndd>>
              Editor to use when editing PKGBUILDs. If this is not set the VVIISSUUAALL environment
              variable will be checked, followed by EEDDIITTOORR. If none of these are set Yay will
              prompt the user for an editor.

       ----eeddiittoorrffllaaggss <<ffllaaggss>>
              Passes arguments to the editor. These flags get passed to every instance where the
              editor is called by Yay. Arguments are split on whitespace before being passed to the
              editor. Multiple arguments may be passed by supplying a space separated list that is
              quoted by the shell.

       ----mmaakkeeppkkgg <<ccoommmmaanndd>>
              The command to use for mmaakkeeppkkgg calls. This can be a command in PPAATTHH or an absolute
              path to the file.

       ----ppaaccmmaann <<ccoommmmaanndd>>
              The command to use for ppaaccmmaann calls. This can be a command in PPAATTHH or an absolute
              path to the file.

       ----ttaarr <<ccoommmmaanndd>>
              The command to use for bbssddttaarr calls. This can be a command in PPAATTHH or an absolute
              path to the file.

       ----ggiitt <<ccoommmmaanndd>>
              The command to use for ggiitt calls. This can be a command in PPAATTHH or an absolute path
              to the file.

       ----ggppgg <<ccoommmmaanndd>>
              The command to use for ggppgg calls. This can be a command in PPAATTHH or an absolute path
              to the file.

       ----ccoonnffiigg <<ffiillee>>
              The pacman config file to use.

       ----mmaakkeeppkkggccoonnff <<ffiillee>>
              The config file for makepkg to use. If this is not set then the default config file
              will be used.

       ----nnoommaakkeeppkkggccoonnff
              Reset the makepkg config file back to its default.

       ----rreeqquueessttsspplliittnn <<nnuummbbeerr>>
              The maximum amount of packages to request per AUR query. The higher the number the
              faster AUR requests will be. Requesting too many packages in one AUR query will cause
              an error. This should only make a noticeable difference with very large requests
              (>500) packages.

       ----ccoommpplleettiioonniinntteerrvvaall <<ddaayyss>>
              Time in days to refresh the completion cache. Setting this to 0 will cause the cache
              to be refreshed every time, while setting this to -1 will cause the cache to never be
              refreshed.

       ----ssoorrttbbyy <<vvootteess||ppooppuullaarriittyy||iidd||bbaasseeiidd||nnaammee||bbaassee||ssuubbmmiitttteedd||mmooddiiffiieedd>>

              Set a predetermined answer for the clean build menu question. This answer will be
              used instead of reading from standard input but will be parsed exactly the same.

       ----aannsswweerrddiiffff <<AAllll||NNoonnee||IInnssttaalllleedd||NNoottIInnssttaalllleedd||......>>
              Set a predetermined answer for the edit diff menu question. This answer will be used
              instead of reading from standard input but will be parsed exactly the same.

       ----aannsswweerreeddiitt <<AAllll||NNoonnee||IInnssttaalllleedd||NNoottIInnssttaalllleedd||......>>
              Set a predetermined answer for the edit pkgbuild menu question. This answer will be
              used instead of reading from standard input but will be parsed exactly the same.

       ----aannsswweerruuppggrraaddee <<RReeppoo||^^RReeppoo||NNoonnee||......>>
              Set a predetermined answer for the upgrade menu question. Selects which package
              ranges or repos to omit for updates. This answer will be used instead of reading from
              standard input but will be treated exactly the same.

       ----nnooaannsswweerrcclleeaann
              Unset the answer for the clean build menu.

       ----nnooaannsswweerrddiiffff
              Unset the answer for the diff menu.

       ----nnooaannsswweerreeddiitt
              Unset the answer for the edit pkgbuild menu.

       ----nnooaannsswweerruuppggrraaddee
              Unset the answer for the upgrade menu.

       ----cclleeaannmmeennuu
              Show the clean menu. This menu gives you the chance to fully delete the downloaded
              build files from Yay's cache before redownloading a fresh copy.

       ----ddiiffffmmeennuu
              Show the diff menu. This menu gives you the option to view diffs from build files
              before building.

              Diffs are shown via ggiitt ddiiffff which uses less by default. This behaviour can be
              changed via git's config, the $$GGIITT__PPAAGGEERR or $$PPAAGGEERR environment variables.

       ----eeddiittmmeennuu
              Show the edit menu. This menu gives you the option to edit or view PKGBUILDs before
              building.

              WWaarrnniinngg: Yay resolves dependencies ahead of time via the RPC. It is not recommended
              to edit pkgbuild variables unless you know what you are doing.

       ----uuppggrraaddeemmeennuu
              Show a detailed list of updates in a similar format to VerbosePkgLists.  Upgrades can
              also be skipped using numbers, number ranges or repo names.  Additionally ^ can be
              used to invert the selection.

              WWaarrnniinngg: It is not recommended to skip updates from the repositories as this can lead
              to partial upgrades. This feature is intended to easily skip AUR updates on the fly
              that may be broken or have a long compile time. Ultimately it is up to the user what
              upgrades they skip.

       ----nnoocclleeaannmmeennuu
              Do not show the clean menu.

       ----nnooddiiffffmmeennuu
              Do not show the diff menu.

       ----nnooeeddiittmmeennuu
              Do not show the edit menu.

       ----nnoouuppggrraaddeemmeennuu
              Do not show the upgrade menu.

       ----aasskkrreemmoovveemmaakkee
              Ask to remove makedepends after installing packages.

       ----rreemmoovveemmaakkee
              Remove makedepends after installing packages.

       ----nnoorreemmoovveemmaakkee
              Do not remove makedepends after installing packages.

       ----ttooppddoowwnn
              Display repository packages first and then AUR packages.

       ----bboottttoommuupp
              Show AUR packages first and then repository packages.

       ----ssiinngglleelliinneerreessuullttss
              Override pacman's usual double-line search result format and list each result on its
              own line.

       ----ddoouubblleelliinneerreessuullttss
              Follow pacman's double-line search result format and list each result using two
              lines.

       ----ddeevveell
              During sysupgrade also check AUR development packages for updates. Currently only Git
              packages are supported.

              Devel checking is done using ggiitt llss--rreemmoottee. The newest commit hash is compared
              against the hash at install time. This allows devel updates to be checked almost
              instantly and not require the original pkgbuild to be downloaded.

              The slower pacaur-like devel checks can be implemented manually by piping a list of
              packages into yay (see eexxaammpplleess).

       ----nnooddeevveell
              Do not check for development packages updates during sysupgrade.

       ----cclleeaannaafftteerr
              Remove untracked files after installation.

              Untracked files are removed with the exception of directories.  This allows VCS
              packages to easily pull an update instead of having to reclone the entire repo.

       ----nnoocclleeaannaafftteerr
              Do not remove package sources after successful Install.

       ----ttiimmeeuuppddaattee
              During sysupgrade also compare the build time of installed packages against the last
              modification time of each package's AUR page.

       ----nnoottiimmeeuuppddaattee
              Do not consider build times during sysupgrade.

       ----sseeppaarraatteessoouurrcceess
              Separate query results by source, AUR and sync

       ----nnoosseeppaarraatteessoouurrcceess
              Do not separate query results by source for searching

       ----rreeddoowwnnllooaadd
              Always download pkgbuilds of targets even when a copy is available in cache.

       ----rreeddoowwnnllooaaddaallll
              Always download pkgbuilds of all AUR packages even when a copy is available in cache.

       ----nnoorreeddoowwnnllooaadd
              When downloading pkgbuilds if the pkgbuild is found in cache and is equal or newer
              than the AUR's version use that instead of downloading a new one.

       ----pprroovviiddeess
              Look for matching providers when searching for AUR packages. When multiple providers
              are found a menu will appear prompting you to pick one. This increases dependency
              resolve time although this should not be noticeable.

       ----nnoopprroovviiddeess
              Do not look for matching providers when searching for AUR packages.  Yay will never
              show its provider menu but Pacman will still show its provider menu for repo
              packages.

       ----ppggppffeettcchh
              Prompt to import unknown PGP keys from the vvaalliiddppggppkkeeyyss field of each PKGBUILD.

       ----nnooppggppffeettcchh
              Do not prompt to import unknown PGP keys. This is likely to cause a build failure
              unless using options such as ----sskkiippppggppcchheecckk or a customized gpg config.

       ----uusseeaasskk
              Use pacman's --ask flag to automatically confirm package conflicts. Yay lists
              conflicts ahead of time. It is possible that Yay does not detect a conflict, causing
              a package to be removed without the user's confirmation.  However, this is very
              unlikely.

       ----nnoouusseeaasskk
              Manually resolve package conflicts during the install. Packages which do not conflict
              will not need to be confined manually.

       ----ccoommbbiinneedduuppggrraaddee
              During sysupgrade, Yay will first perform a refresh, then show its combined menu of
              repo and AUR packages that will be upgraded. Then after reviewing the pkgbuilds, the
              repo and AUR upgrade will start with no need for manual intervention.

              If Yay exits for any reason After the refresh without upgrading. It is then the
              user's responsibility to either resolve the reason Yay exited or run a sysupgrade
              through pacman directly.

       ----nnooccoommbbiinneedduuppggrraaddee
              During sysupgrade, Pacman -Syu will be called, then the AUR upgrade will start. This
              means the upgrade menu and pkgbuild review will be performed after the sysupgrade has
              finished.

       ----bbaattcchhiinnssttaallll
              When building and installing AUR packages instead of installing each package after
              building, queue each package for install. Then once either all packages are built or
              a package in the build queue is needed as a dependency to build another package,
              install all the packages in the install queue.

       ----nnoobbaattcchhiinnssttaallll
              Always install AUR packages immediately after building them.

       ----rreebbuuiilldd
              Always build target packages even when a copy is available in cache.

       ----rreebbuuiillddaallll
              Always build all AUR packages even when a copy is available in cache.

       ----rreebbuuiillddttrreeee
              When installing an AUR package rebuild and reinstall all of its AUR dependencies
              recursively, even the ones already installed. This flag allows you to easily rebuild
              packages against your current system's libraries if they have become incompatible.

       ----nnoorreebbuuiilldd
              When building packages if the package is found in cache and is an equal version to
              the one wanted skip the package build and use the existing package.

       ----mmffllaaggss <<ffllaaggss>>
              Passes arguments to makepkg. These flags get passed to every instance where makepkg
              is called by Yay. Arguments are split on whitespace before being passed to makepkg.
              Multiple arguments may be passed by supplying a space separated list that is quoted
              by the shell.

       ----ggppggffllaaggss <<ffllaaggss>>
              Passes arguments to gpg. These flags get passed to every instance where gpg is called
              by Yay. Arguments are split on whitespace before being passed to gpg. Multiple
              arguments may be passed by supplying a space separated list that is quoted by the
              shell.

       ----ssuuddoo <<ccoommmmaanndd>>
              The command to use for ssuuddoo calls. This can be a command in PPAATTHH or an absolute path
              to the file.  The sudoloop is not guaranteed to work with a custom ssuuddoo command.

       ----ssuuddooffllaaggss <<ffllaaggss>>
              Passes arguments to sudo. These flags get passed to every instance where sudo is
              called by Yay. Arguments are split on whitespace before being passed to sudo.
              Multiple arguments may be passed by supplying a space separated list that is quoted
              by the shell.

       ----ssuuddoolloooopp
              Loop sudo calls in the background to prevent sudo from timing out during long builds.

       ----nnoossuuddoolloooopp
